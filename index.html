                    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" target="_blank">BYOD</a>). And since you have to provide rewards that your customers can exchange their punches for; your Loyalty Program can't be "free". However our software, which makes it all work,

        <h1 class="text-center v-center">How are these better?</h1>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center animatedParent">
          <p class="animated fadeIn">... Or at least; you
            <em>think</em>your Traditional Punch Card system works well; but you actually have very little data as to how your cards are being used.
            <br style="margin-top: 5px;">How many people are participating? How many outstanding punches are there? Which of your employees encourage the most customers to participate? How&nbsp;much does your Loyalty Program cost you and what's your ROI?</p>
          <p class="animated fadeIn">Another issue with the traditional punch card is that it is limited to encouraging a very specific behaviour: the
            <em>buy 10 get 1 free</em>behaviour. Which is unfortunate because there are several other behaviours that businesses would also like to encourage in their customers.</p>
          <p class="animated fadeIn">QR&nbsp;Loyalty&nbsp;Cards solves these issues by using 2D bar codes (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR&nbsp;Codes</a>) to connect cards (and customers) to a live database. This connection allows the QR&nbsp;Loyalty&nbsp;Cards application to collect far more data about how each card is used. Data that can be used to provide access to detailed analytics and reports that can help you to understand exactly how effective your program is and what you can do to improve it. Data that can also be used to reward customers for exhibiting behaviours that increase spending and grow your customer base. For example: your business can reward customers who
            <strong>visit every day of the week</strong>, who
            <strong>share one of your specials</strong>or events on Facebook, who
            <strong>bring a friend</strong>, or
            <strong>return after a long absence</strong>.</p>
          <p class="animated fadeIn">Employees punch cards in much the same way that they always have, except instead of using a hole puncher or dabber, they use a mobile device. The Interface is extremely simple and almost entirely automatic.</p>
          <p class="animated fadeIn">QR&nbsp;Loyalty&nbsp;Cards have many features; including a Soft Card option where customers can turn their mobile devices into their punch card, a Coalition Loyalty Program where business can create joint Loyalty Programs (e.g. Dinner and a Movie) or offer rewards for businesses that don't have rewards that they can provide themselves, and timely ads pushed out to your customer's softcards as well as your company's Facebook feed.</p>
          <p class="animated fadeIn">The software is free; and has a built in card designer that your business can use to upload card designs and download ZIP files containing a bundle of custom print files and printing instructions. QR&nbsp;Loyalty&nbsp;Cards also offers a
            <a href="/fullservice/new">Full Service package</a>where your business can have the cards designed and printed for you; as you enjoy expert loyalty program support and advice.</p></div>
